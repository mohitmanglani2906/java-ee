Dependancies Injection

design pattern in any project 
like dependancies injection 

why to use it?
we build project with object
objects are dependant on other objects

like ram screen hard disk in laptop

class Laptop
{
	HardDrive d1 = new Hitachi(); // Normal case

	@Autowired
	HardDrive d1;
}

@Component
class Hitachi implements HardDrive
{
	..............
}



advantage:
test it better as it loosely coupled maintain it
mock object can created to check or to test the one class without affecting other class(Database Class)

Hey Friends we are going learn spring boot security

consider the case below one user is creating account in facebook
Here we store our passwords and email id for log in into facebook
But these passwords and emails are stored in facebook server and any of facebook admin or DBA can see our info.

Here Spring boot security comes into the picture that it says that I will give security to your passwords and I will encrypt those
passwords

Spring boot provides us Oauth2 , ldap , SHA 256 and Bcrypt libraries

We will use it
Thank you!!!
